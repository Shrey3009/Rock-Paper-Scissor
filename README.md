As small as it looks .. it's super fun to automate it using code. Starting small and trying to learn things from basics and then gradually advancing to the better versions was the motive behind choosing this topic.

What it does
It takes the users choice and simultaneously generates a Bot's choice. The winner is found among the two and then the game proceeds by given the respective points to either of the two. The draw condition does not add to anyone's credits.

How we built it
Used HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT

Challenges we ran into
For a beginner everything seemed a challenge to be honest.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
The first time I read the documentation of JavaScript carefully and understood it.

What's next for Rock-Paper-Scissor Bot
I'll try to add an animated object beside to give expressions as the game proceeds and make the overall experience more fun.
